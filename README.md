# OOAD project 1, The Friendly Zoo

**Team Members**: Jake Andrus and Zora Watters  
**Running code**: Our main method is located in the Zookeeper class! <br/>
**Assumptions**: Animals all sleep, eat, and roam, make noise, and wake up. <br/>
We have classes for each species, type, and Animal itself, as well as Zoo and Zookeeper. Some functions are overriden as specific to the animal!
